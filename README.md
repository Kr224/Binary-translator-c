This project is an x86 binary translator designed to convert instructions from a specific architecture (x) to x86 assembly language. It provides a tool for translating code written for one architecture to code executable on x86-based systems.

Features:
Instruction Translation: Converts instructions from the source architecture to x86 assembly language.
Architecture Agnostic: Designed to be adaptable to different source architectures.
Support for Common Instructions: Supports translation of common instruction sets to x86.
Error Handling: Provides error handling mechanisms for unsupported or invalid instructions.
